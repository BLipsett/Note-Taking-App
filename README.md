# Note-Taking-App
* This application was built to learn some of the concepts of Express, Node, and databases while further working on JS, JQuery, and API skills. 
* Users are able to input their desired note with a title and information block. Then their note is saved into a "JSON database" and their note card appears on the left of the screen.
